# willcarh.art
[willcarh.art](https://willcarh.art) is Will Carhart's personal porfolio website. This repository is for the most recent version of willcarh.art. For information on v1, please see the [v1 repository](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art-v1).

### Generating the website
[willcarh.art](https://willcarh.art) is a statically generated site. It uses a custom Node.js generator to replace template HTML with content sourced from markdown files.

Before starting, you'll need Node.js and Yarn. You can install them with `brew install node` and `brew install yarn`.

To start a new build, use the forge. Dependencies will be auto-resolved upon first build attempt.
```bash
./forge --help
```
```
forge - build pages for willcarh.art

Usage:
forge [-h] [-b] [-d] [-s] [-v]
  -h, --help      Show this menu and exit
  -b, --browser   Open the newly built website in a new browser window
  -d, --develop   Do not exit on validation errors
  -s, --silent    Silence build output
  -v, --verbose   Show generated files as a result of forge
```

### Understanding this respository
The _forge_ ([`forge`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/forge), [`generator/generator.js`](https://github.com/wcarhart/willcarh.art/blob/master/generator/generator.js)) generates webpages based on HTML, CSS, and JS templates. When a new version of the site is generated, the forge utilizes the files in `generator/` to build valid webpages and components in `src/`. It pulls templates from these directories:
* `templates/` - template HTML files for building the webpages in `src/`
* `js/` - template JS files to be included in `src/`
* `snippets/` - HTML and JS snippets from which to build content, used repeatedly throughout the website

And populates them based on files in from `content/`. In addition, static assets are linked from these directories:
* `css/` - static css files
* `font/` - static font files
* `ico/` - static icon files

In addition, the following files are utilized:
|File|Purpose|
|----|-------|
|`.gitignore`|describes what items to ignore in git|
|`_redirects`|configures routes for Netlify|
|`config.json`|the current configurations for the built website|
|`forge`|the file that invokes the generator|
|`index.html`|the entrypoint for the built website; despite not being in `src/`, `index.html` is still an autogenerated file, but must be in the base directory of the repository in order to be served from Netlify|
|`package.json`|standard package JSON generated by Yarn for the generator|
|`README.md`|the file, which describes the repository|
|`res.md`|resource file for miscellaneous notes and resources relevant to willcarh.art|
|`yarn.lock`|standard yarn lock file generated by Yarn to describe the dependencies of the generator|
