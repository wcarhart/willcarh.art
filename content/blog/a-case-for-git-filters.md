### Git's lesser known features
I'm starting to realize that every time I want to do something in Git that someone else has already written functionality for it. A quick web search shows some lesser known features like [`git stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) and [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick). But, what if I only want to commit a few lines of the code I've written in a file? Yes, feature already exists, use [`git add -p`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt---patch). Okay, but what if I found a bug in my current branch and don't know how to find what commit created it? Yes, feature already exists, use [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect). Since its birth in 2005, Git has become one of the most pleasant, fully-featured software tools I use day-to-day (when it does what I want). Let's look at one of the most powerful, underutilized Git features: Git filters.
