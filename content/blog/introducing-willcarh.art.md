### A New Home
I'm very excited to announce the launch of my latest personal project: [willcarh.art]({{sys:home}})

I think for most people, coding can seem like a foreign language, an abstract dialect in which eclectic individuals speak to computers - and they're not entirely wrong. Taking some green text on a terminal screen and converting it to websites and mobile applications is the black magic of the modern age. And that's exactly why I love it.
Writing software is one of my passions. I think it's creative, expressive, and fun. Want to make a website about [bouncing cats?](https://cat-bounce.com/) Go right ahead. Want to make an iPhone app that [gives you a daily compliment?](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/da-daily-compliment/id711717136?mt=8) Be my guest. Yes, these are silly examples, but the point is writing software can be a hobby, too. And, for most developers, I think it is.
I've wanted to build a personal website for a while. As much as I hate to admit it, most average people don't get too excited about CLIs. I'm sure every developer at some point has spent weeks on a cool command line utility, only to have the uninitiated proclaim that's it? So, I decided to build [willcarh.art]({{sys:home}}), **the world's greatest personal website**, per me. And, as an aspiring Pythonista, I wrote it in Python.
So, without further ado, please explore and enjoy! Read about some of my [projects]({{src:project_index.html}}), or check out some of my other [blog posts]({{src:blog_index.html}}) (more coming soon). You can also learn more about how the website works. Feel free to [drop me a note](mailto:hello@willcarh.art) if you have any questions!
