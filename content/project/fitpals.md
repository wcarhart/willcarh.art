# Stay in shape. Do it together.

### A fun idea
FitPals was another prototype iOS application I made in college. The concept was to create a social media network similar to Instagram where the subject of the network would be fitness and exercise. I was on a team of three students who created a proof of concept app that supported posts (workouts, pictures, and meal plans), feeds, and users with authentication through Firebase.
This project was solely a prototype. Although the iOS app was fairly featured, it never had a backend and has no publishing plans.
