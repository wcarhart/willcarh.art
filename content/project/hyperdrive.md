## Create websites from Google Drive folders, automagically.

### Build a simple photo sharing site via Google Drive
Sometimes you want to share photos with folks who are less technology-inclined. Hyperdrive allows you to easily spin up photo-sharing websites from Google Drive folders. Anyone can update the photos in the folder and the images will be automatically synced with the Hyperdrive website. Hyperdrive builds a simple Express.js app that is packed with customizations.
