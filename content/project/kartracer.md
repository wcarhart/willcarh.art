## An experiment in building a racing game with zero pre-built assets.

### A simple racing game
Kartracer was a my final project for my university graphics class. It is incredibly basic, utilizing no prebuilt models and only OpenGL primitives, but still has a small array of features. It has 3 different car models, a full race track, and a number of various camera views.

### Fully featured, primitive graphics
Depsite the primitive graphics, the game still had plenty of cool features:
* 3 different car models, built on-the-fly in game
* each car model has been given specific careful details: the sports car has a spoiler, an air intake on the hood, and a shorter wheelbase; the F1 car has realistic aerodynamics, a double spoiler, three, big exhaust pipes, and a roofless cockpit; the truck has bigger tires and guard around the flatbed to keep cargo from coming out
* a full race track with check points and circuit timing
* multiple dynamic camera positions
* working speedometer
* toggleable minimap
* 20 different vehicle colors
* intelligent keypress detection
* working, but primitive, physics engine
