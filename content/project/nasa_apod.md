## Learn about space on a daily basis.

### A fun API
NASA APoD stands for [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). I wrote a simple iOS app to pull down the APoD using NASA's public API and then display it within the app. The app can display any APoD between June 16th, 1995, when the program started, and now. This application was a toy project and has not been published on the App Store.

### A plethora of content
Choose an APoD for any day between June 16th, 1995, when NASA started the program, and today. Media can range from pictures of planets, telescopes, stars, comets, and so much more!
