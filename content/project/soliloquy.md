# A platform for showcasing your software hobby projects.

### A place for sharing
I think there's an unfortunate stereotype that often surrounds software development. Many characterize coding as a purely technical discipline, reserved for the nerdy and erudite. However, I think coding can be expressive, fun, and creative. You can create anything you can imagine, from complex web applications to beautiful front-end designs.
That's why I created soliloquy, as a place for hackers and software enthusiasts to showcase their passion projects and promote Software-as-a-Hobby. The word _soliloquy_ means the act of speaking one's thoughts aloud regardless of any hearers, which fits the purpose of Soliloquy aptly.
